# EECS 348 - Software Engineering I

Taken with [Dr. Hossein Saiedian](https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~saiedian/) in Fall 2023.

Only includes programming labs with coding solutions (ie. Lab 1 is git usage, Lab 3 is UML diagramming, et. cetera)

## Grades

> [!NOTE]
> Extra credit Lab1 was not completed
>
> Lab5 (-2) - formatting not per guidance. Good practice outputting to file, next time output to the terminal.
>
> Lab11 has overly complicated regex. You can probably use a simpler pattern...
